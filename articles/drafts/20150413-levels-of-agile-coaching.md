#!!==========================================================

I've recently come to believe that successful agile transformation is so tied up with culture that it's impossible to consider one without the other. This might explain why some of the more successful teams I've seen didn't need any agile training, or a system of work like Scrum.

Because their culture supported adaptive planning, cross-functional people and agility by default, the practices recommended by scrum, XP and the like were either unnecessary, or seemed blindingly obvious.

As someone who first learned to program using Ruby, it never occurred to me that people might build software without test coverage,  database migrations and a focus on quality. And as someone who often worked alone or in small teams, it seemed natural to pair up with another developer when we were both working on the same thing. I wasn't aware these were parts of Extreme Programming until much later. This is because I'd learned to program from the ruby community, and had adopted its culture by accident.

Daily stand-ups and retrospectives were also things that came naturally to me, as a result of another culture I'd been immersed in. Thanks to my work with the RAF Air Cadet Organisation, I've spent a fair few years watching very similar *ceremonies*.

At the beginning of each day it's usual for instructors to gather for a briefing on the day's work. Although the senior person *might* give some direction, it's pretty normal for everyone to just outline their plans for the day and raise anything they think might be a problem. This is essentially an opportunity for the training team to get on the same page – much the same as a daily scrum without the *What did I do yesterday?*

Although many perceive the military as fiercely autocratic, it would be impossible to develop leadership if that was the case. Junior commanders are empowered to take charge of their workloads and make their own plans—it's called Mission Command. Combine this with the **shared responsibility & ownership** that inevitably results from working and living so closely with others, and the parallels with agile are fairly obvious.

Retrospectives also feature, although by a different name. After any training activity its usual for the personnel involved to gather for a debrief—in fact, it's so normal to ask "How do you think that went?" after a training exercise that it's almost become a catchphrase. The key thing here is not the debrief itself—*Lessons Learned* meetings have been done for a long time—but rather that these meetings are almost always driven buy a **genuine desire to learn and improve**.

Because of my exposure to these (Ruby and military) cultures, many of the values, thought patterns and practices that I later learned were part of agile were easy to adopt.

I'm beginning to think that there are three distinct but closely connected levels at which agile coaching should be directed. Let's start with the one the community traditionally emphasises: the delivery team.

## Level 2: The Delivery Team
Most agile training and coaching seems to occur at this level. We might introduce Kanban or Scrum, or work to improve user stories and acceptance criteria. We might introduce new tools like Sprintly, JIRA, Slack or HipChat; or a new workflow using Git and automated build pipelines.
 
Although many of the activities associated with training and coaching delivery teams—TDD, version control, pairing, BDD etc—apply to individuals, most of them cannot be adopted in isolation. Their success is dependant on whole-team adoption.
 
All of this has enormous value for teams, but without the right culture it can end in failure. And it can be hard to change team culture. Instead, we might try to influence it by gradually introducing agile practices. This can work, but I can't help but wonder if there's more we could to with individuals.

Before we get on to that, lets look at the third level: the organisation.

## Level 3: The Organisation
Sometimes called 'Enterprise Agile',  this typically involves managing large-scale organisational change. The process is complex, and there is no silver bullet[^1].

When formulating a strategy we might focus on better defining the product vision, streamlining the flow of value or improving governance and visibility. We might work with HR to improve attraction, hiring and L&D processes. These can all have an impact on culture, but changing organisational culture is a mammoth task. We all have a great deal more to learn about how it can be achieved.

That said, I'm certain of one thing: No amount of strategy, policy and process work can achieve cultural change on its own. Culture is a group phenomenon, but it stems from the beliefs of individuals.

## Level 1: The Individual
Work with individuals is often aimed at getting them to 'buy in'. How do we help people internalise the agile values  and mindset.

Akin to Life Coaching.

What could we do to help individual *people* be more agile and adaptable? 

{{imageraw: DEFINITION OF AGILE FROM GOOGLE}} 

Might include:
- Defining their personal values
- Helping to remove unwanted uncertainty in their lives both in and out of work, so as to make the inherent uncertainty in agile development at work less daunting and more exciting.
 - Help them become inspired by their work
 - Enthuse them to take pride in what they do - how?
 - Inspire them to be hungry to do better - how?
 - Encouraging camaraderie like the military - how? Team building trips certainly isn't the answer.
- Agile mindset
- Taking responsibility
- Sustainable pace, and personal growth (GTD, health, CPD etc)
- Individual practices (code Katas etc)
 

Although we can't hope to work directly with every individual in a large organisation, we can work with those who are most likely to inspire and enthuse others to alter their views. This might be senior management, but it might also be evangelistic employees at any level.

...

To summarise, I'm suggesting that there are three levels we should work at to change culture:

1. The Individual
2. The Delivery Team
3. The Organisation

 Although it's impossible to tackle each of these in isolation,  agile transformation can sometimes focus more on the process than the people. For me, though, **Agile is all about the people**.
 
# Is this a new idea?

Not at all. Three days after I drafted this article I stumbled across [this presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/mcottmeyer/exploring-agile-transformation-and-scaling-patterns) by Mike Cottmeyer of [LeadingAgile](http://leadingagile.com/). It outlines an iterative approach to  transformation based on the three levels we've just discussed.  One of his key takeaways is this:

<blockquote><p>To lead sustainable organizational change, you have to address the structure of the organization, your practices and tools, and also the people in the organization.</p></blockquote> 

I agree wholeheartedly with him.

I'm not suggesting that we all rush off and become [Life Coaches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaching#Life_coaching), but I am asking: **What more can we do to help our people improve on a personal level?**
