title: What is Good Design (and the Government Digital Service)

#!!==========================================================

For a long while, I’ve had a bit of a thing for eye candy and swooshey effects. As a designer, I’ve tried hard to avoid overcomplicating designs just because I want to get my fix of eye candy.

I’ve recently been doing a lot of work using type and blocks of colour, and have consequently been playing a lot with layout. My recent acquisition of a bigger-than 13.3” screen (I now work more-or-less in one place) has given me a little more freedom, as has [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/), which is super easy to use for playing about with ideas.

This was going to be a long and detailed post about the emergence of “flat design” and the impact Google Maps for iPhone had on me. It turns out that John Gruber wrote [an excellent post](http://daringfireball.net/2013/01/the_trend_against_skeuomorphism) on the subject last Friday. In it, he says:

<blockquote>
On retina displays, as with high quality print output, these techniques are revealed for what they truly are: an assortment of parlor tricks that fool our eyes into thinking we see something that looks good on a display that is technically incapable of rendering graphic design that truly looks good.

Reading John’s article sent me hunting around the new(ish) UK [Government Digital Services](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/) website. Their team is doing an inspiring job of rebuilding the government’s web presence so that it actually works. The design of [gov.uk](http://gov.uk/) is content-focussed and very, very “flat”. It’s also fantastic. So instead of writing about flat design, I’m going to flatter gov.uk for a bit…

Anyone who’s tried to find information on DirectGov, HMRC or another government-based website, I defy you to look at [these pages](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates) and not be impressed! The search works brilliantly and although there are still a whole bunch of departments moving their information over (I feel for the IA’s working there, as well as envying them for the opportunity to work on this), we’re assured that [more are moving soon](https://www.gov.uk/government).

Before I stop gushing about the government’s new web stuff, it’s great to see that a key focus seems to be content creation and style. With such a vast amount of information to present, it’s clearly important. It’s worth noting that along with the move to a more cohesive and useable web presence, they’ve started to get rid of some of the awful logos that were once mandatory for government departments. Paul Lloyd (a fellow Brightonian) [wrote about this](http://www.paulrobertlloyd.com/2009/09/a_cohesive_and_unified_identity_for_british_government/) in 2009.

Anyone who works on the web should read GDS’ [Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples) and [Styleguide](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide). It’s worth the half-hour it’ll take.

Oh, and as well as being clear fans of Gill Sans, GDS have [designed](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/07/05/a-few-notes-on-typography/) an [updated](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/transport-new/) version of Transport, the typeface used on UK road signs. Here’s a [particularly interesting](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/11/13/designing-for-the-long-read-on-inside-government/) article on how setting copy in Transport New appeared to highlight the clumsy nature of some type:

<blockquote>
It’s easy to overlook the Department of Transport’s consistent and functional restraint with language on road signs, a writing style that is indelibly linked to the typeface.
…I hoped that by using it we would somehow be able to piggyback on those pre-existing language conventions to encourage more straightforward writing.
I’ve been pleasantly surprised to hear that (at least anecdotally) this is the case. Texts which would previously have seemed respectable in traditional document fonts like Times are revealed as opaque and clumsy in Transport. People have then rewritten these, un-prompted, after writers has seen them on the site.
</blockquote>

### Back to "Flat" Design

Good graphic design is hard. It’s even harder when working within the web’s constraints. Fundamentally though, I’m beginning to believe that good design can be achieved by a mixture of designed content, good type and good layout, coupled with the **time to play around and create**.

Here’s two final thoughts, appropriately from one of Paul Lloyd’s confederates and Russel Davies, whose blog I found through GDS’ [lead designer](http://noisydecentgraphics.typepad.com/):

<blockquote>So this is the dirty little secret in our industry. The best designers and developers rarely have more talent. They simply have more time.
